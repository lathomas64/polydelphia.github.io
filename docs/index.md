## Mission Statement

Polydelphia’s mission is to provide a safe, welcoming, inclusive community for people in the greater Philadelphia area who are practicing or exploring ethical non-monogamy - a community that brings people together for open discussion, networking, advocacy and recreation.

## Core Values

### *Because we value **inclusiveness**…*

We welcome all people interested in the pursuit of ethical non-monogamy, regardless of age, race, religion, sexual and gender identity (including asexual and agender), disability, family and relationship status, and socioeconomic status.

### *Because we value **safety and consent**…*

We affirm that consent is mandatory in all sexual and romantic encounters. We uphold the right of all people to live free of abuse, assault, and coercion. The events and communication platforms of Polydelphia are never to be used to harass, abuse, or violate others.

### *Because we value **pleasure and freedom**…*

We support all people in pursuing joy within consensual adult relationships, in whatever form it takes. We do not judge others for their sexual or romantic preferences; kinksters, self-described sluts, asexuals, and aromantics, are all equally welcome in our community.

### *Because we value **education and advocacy**…*

We strive to provide a platform for the sharing of knowledge on polyamory, ethical non-monogamy, and resources for our community.

### *Because we value **respectful and constructive communication**…*

We seek to provide an environment in which all voices may be heard, and in which open discussion is welcome. We ask members to consider [calling in rather than calling out](http://everydayfeminism.com/2015/03/calling-in-and-calling-out/), recognizing that we are all learning. However, tone policing or other silencing tactics are unwelcome. Slurs, ad hominem attacks, and dehumanizing language will not be tolerated.

### *Because we value **community engagement**…*

We are committed to a decision-making process that is transparent, egalitarian, and that actively seeks the input and involvement of the entire community, explicitly centering the voices of people from traditionally marginalized groups.
